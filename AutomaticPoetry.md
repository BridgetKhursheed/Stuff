# Night work #

I work in the middle of the night and why not; it is **easier and quieter**. I like to listen to the owls; their bureaucracy; their edible sound; their ears that cannot hear me. I work in the night and at the dawn I wake.

I work in the raindrops tapping icily at me in it to the canyon and why not much of the night and went west on his left hand. I work in the night and at the night and at the big razzoo. I work in the rain still pounded, waiting for my drink, vanished.

I work in the entering gust. I wake. I like to listen to listen to listen to **listen to my heart**! said I work in the dungeons there had I work in flames. I wake. I like a hideous-- of the courage to the pit. I was now I dared-- oh, and why not; their ears that cannot!

I work in the middle of the Queen. I wake.. I won't indeed, the owls; it only to turn into a long silence, to your little boy! He sought the owls; it is a dreamy delirious fight: I weep. I weep. He sought the night and why not; their heads off?

I work in half with me on ether and **hit the TV set**. I gave him a maniac would lock me. I advise you to the blood! Don't try it is your chest, sun, I wake. What kind of a stainless-steel hunting knife with a giddy, to listen to listen to rip his lungs out on top!

I work in his vorpal blade went galumphing back. *I like that cannot endure*! I like to listen to listen to turn into mutton pies, if you ask! What's the owls; it only to the middle of the dawn I am real! And, I weep. That's very curious!

I work in the middle of the night and why not; it is **easier and quieter**. I like to listen to the owls; their bureaucracy; their edible sound; their ears that cannot hear me. I work in the night and at the dawn I wake.
